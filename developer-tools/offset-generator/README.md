## About

The OffsetGenerator tool is a simple way to calculate offset values from mileposts and spit out a geojson object.

## Prerequisites
To generate the offsets, you will need to have the following:
- sampledata.json updated with the mileposts you want to generate offsets for
- anchor point to generate from (updated in python script)

## Running

This script runs with python and can be ran as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./main.py
```
